# A-Level-Course-Work
I am unable to upload the document to GitHub due to their being a 100MB limit, however this documention will be sent to you via Email. This document was the final submition for my A Level Computer Science Course Work in which I built a Password Management System using Java.swing. The document will take you all the way from inital concept to the final code appendix at the end, and contains a detailed and thorough explaination of the project guiding you through the development of it. It was sent off to OCR (the exam board) and I was given an A* (58/60) for the project (proof can be requested).
